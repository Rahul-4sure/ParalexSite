            <p class="text">
                The Hulk is one of Marvel Comics’ most iconic superheroes, known for his immense strength and complex dual nature. First appearing in The Incredible Hulk #1 in 1962, the character was created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby. The Hulk is the alter ego of Dr. Bruce Banner, a brilliant scientist specializing in gamma radiation. After being exposed to a massive dose of gamma rays during an experiment gone wrong, Banner transforms into the Hulk whenever he experiences extreme anger or stress.
                Physically, the Hulk is a towering green-skinned giant with extraordinary superhuman strength, durability, and regenerative abilities. He grows stronger as his anger intensifies, making him virtually unstoppable in combat. Despite his intimidating appearance and destructive tendencies, the Hulk is often portrayed as a misunderstood figure, more driven by a desire for solitude and peace than by malice. His duality with Bruce Banner is central to the character's narrative, as Banner constantly struggles to control or rid himself of the Hulk, viewing his alter ego as a curse.
                The Hulk’s emotional depth is also key to his character. While often seen as a symbol of raw, uncontrollable power, he also embodies themes of loneliness, alienation, and the internal battle between the mind and body. Over the years, different versions of the Hulk have been explored, from the intelligent and calculating "Professor Hulk" to the savage, child-like "Green Hulk." The Hulk has appeared across various media, including comic books, animated series, and blockbuster films, where he plays a pivotal role in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) as a founding member of the Avengers. His character resonates with audiences for his ability to be both a destructive force and a tragic hero in search of acceptance and control over his darker side.
